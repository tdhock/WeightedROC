Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis is one way to
evaluate an algorithm for binary classification. R packages
ROCR/pROC/AUC/PerfMeas/PRROC implement ROC curve computation. However,
if the observations have weights (non-uniform loss, see [[https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/WeightedROC/vignettes/Definition.pdf][Definition]]
vignette) then these packages can not be used. The WeightedROC package
implements ROC and Area Under the Curve (AUC) computation for weighted
binary classification problems.

- *weights* shows which packages allow weights (non-uniform loss for each observation).
- *tests* shows which R packages implement [[file:tests/testthat/test-auc.R][unit tests]] to check that the
  ROC/AUC is computed correctly.
- *lines of R code* shows how many lines of code were used in the pkg/R/* files.
  Note that WeightedROC has the simplest implementation other than glmnet::auc.
- *cumsum* shows whether or not the cumsum function is used to compute
  the ROC curve. Using the cumsum function is simple to code and fast
  -- see the [[https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/WeightedROC/vignettes/Speed.pdf][Speed vignette]].

** When to use PRROC? 

For "soft" real-valued labels (not "hard" labels $\in \{-1, 1\}$), and
[[https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~page/rocpr.pdf][accurate interpolation]] of Precision-Recall curves, use PRROC. Note
that PRROC uses the word "Weighted" to mean something completely
different (soft labels) than the weights in this package (non-uniform
loss), as explained in their [[http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0092209][PLOS ONE paper]].

** When to use ROCR?

To compute other evaluation metrics (e.g. lift) use the ROCR
package. WeightedROC does not implement evaluation metrics other than
ROC/AUC.

** When to use pROC?

To compute the partial AUC and compare curves using statistical tests
use the pROC package. WeightedROC does not implement these features.

** When to use glmnet?

The glmnet package includes an =auc= function for computing AUC, but
does not include a function for computing the ROC curve. So it
actually can compute the AUC faster than WeightedROC, for both equal
or unequal weights. WARNINGS:
- make sure the class labels are either 0 or 1 (not factors, not -1 or
  1 -- these will give the incorrect result, with no warning/error).
- if the data set has tied scores AND weights, glmnet::auc computes
  something different, see =example(WeightedAUC)=.
